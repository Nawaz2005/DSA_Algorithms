Here are the codes of linearsearch and binarysearch
A 'linear search' scans each element one by one in a list until it finds the target value or reaches the end, suitable for small datasets but less efficient for larger ones.
'Binary search' compares the target value to the middle element of a sorted list and repeats the process in the appropriate half until the value is found or the search space is empty, efficient for large sorted datasets with O(log n) complexity.
